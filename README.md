# goal-tracker

This a fully responsive React app for tracking your goals based on their priorities. There's a Progress Bar for displaying each of the goals checked and done.
I've tried to make use of different React Hooks and concepts such as useState, useEffect and also forwardRef besides react-icons library in order to make it a robust and modern app. (under development)

# Features

- Implementing a pagination for displaying GoalList with a cool, smooth animation on page transition
- Using Framer Motion library for having a cool animation on each transition including icon transition between rockets and check when checking the goal
- Making use of Canvas-Confetti library to celebrate each goal being checked and done by the user by rendering dynamic and animated effectes with particles.
