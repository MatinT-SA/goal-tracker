# goal-tracker

This a fully responsive React app for tracking your goals based on their priorities. There's a Progress Bar for displaying each of the goals checked and done.
I've tried to make use of different React Hooks and concepts such as useState, useEffect and also forwardRef besides react-icons library in order to make it a robust and modern app. (under development)
