# goal-tracker

This is a fully responsive React app for tracking your goals based on their priorities. There's a Progress Bar for displaying each of the goals checked and done.
I've utilized various React Hooks and concepts, such as useState, useEffect, and forwardRef, along with the react-icons library to make it a robust and modern app. (Under development)

# Features

- Pagination with Smooth Animations: Implemented pagination for displaying the Goal List with smooth animations on page transitions using Framer Motion.

- Dynamic Animations: Created a cool icon transition between a rocket and a checkmark when checking off a goal.

- Celebratory Effects: Incorporated Canvas-Confetti to celebrate each goal completion with dynamic particle effects.

- Date Selection: Added goal deadlines using the React Datepicker component for a seamless user experience.

- Theme Switcher: Implemented a theme toggle using the React Switch component.

- Notifications: Integrated Sonner for toast notifications to inform users about important actions.

- Spring Animations: Used React Spring to add smooth, interactive animations.
